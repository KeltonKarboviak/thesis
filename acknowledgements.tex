	I would first like to thank my advisor, Dr. Travis Desell.  He consistently allowed this Thesis to be my own work, but steered me in the right direction with his expertise in many areas whenever I needed help.

	I would also like to thank the numerous aviation experts who provided me with their insights on Flight Data Analysis:  Prof. Brandon Wild, John Walberg, Dr. Mark Dusenbury, and Prof. James Higgins.  Without their passionate participation and input, my work could not have been successfully implemented.
	
	I wholeheartedly would like to thank all of my committee members:  Dr. Travis Desell, Dr. Hassan Reza, and Prof. Brandon Wild.  I consider it an honor that they agreed to work with me, and I am gratefully indebted to them for their very valuable comments on this Thesis.
	
	Last but not the least, I must express my very profound gratitude to my wife, family, and friends for their prayers, unfailing support, and continuous encouragement throughout my graduate studies.  This accomplishment would not have been possible without them.  Thank you.
